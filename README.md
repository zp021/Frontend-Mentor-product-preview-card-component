## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned


Using the <picture> element was a good solution for this challenge as it reduces the amout of code and use of media queries.


### Continued development

Going forawrd, I would like to solidify knowlege of both flexbox and grid and explore all of the options within those concepts. Also, I would like to expand my understanding of media queries and responsive design.
